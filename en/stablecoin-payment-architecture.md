# Stablecoin Payment Architecture: Technical Considerations

> Part of the [Stablecoins and C2B Payments Overview](../Overview-EN.md) series

## Introduction

Implementing stablecoin payments in consumer-to-business (C2B) flows requires navigating both blockchain technology and practical financial infrastructure. This article examines the key architectural decisions, technical components, and implementation considerations that businesses must address when integrating stablecoin payments.

Understanding these technical foundations is essential for building robust, scalable, and compliant stablecoin payment systems.

## 1. Stablecoin Design and Smart Contracts

### Fiat-Collateralized Architecture

The dominant stablecoins today (USDT, USDC, PYUSD, etc.) use a **fiat-collateralized** model:

**Design Principles:**
- Each token is backed by equivalent fiat asset reserves
- Reserves held by the issuer (typically cash or short-term U.S. Treasuries)
- 1:1 redemption guarantee
- Regular third-party attestations/audits
- Transparent reserve composition reporting[^1]

**Smart Contract Functions:**

Basic ERC-20/equivalent functionality:
```solidity
// Core functions
mint(address to, uint256 amount)      // Issuer creates new tokens
burn(address from, uint256 amount)    // Issuer destroys tokens
transfer(address to, uint256 amount)  // User sends tokens
```

**Regulatory Compliance Features:**
```solidity
// Compliance functions
freeze(address account)               // Issuer freezes account
unfreeze(address account)             // Issuer unfreezes account
blacklist(address account)            // Permanently block account
```

These compliance features allow issuers to respond to:
- Law enforcement requests
- Sanctions screening hits
- Illicit activity detection
- Regulatory orders

### Alternative Designs (Historical Context)

**Crypto-Collateralized:**
- Backed by other cryptocurrencies (e.g., DAI backed by ETH)
- Over-collateralized to absorb volatility
- Decentralized but capital-inefficient
- Limited adoption for payments due to complexity

**Algorithmic:**
- No collateral; relies on supply/demand mechanisms
- High-profile failures (Terra/UST collapse 2022)
- Regulatory skepticism
- Generally avoided for payment applications[^2][^3]

**Industry Consensus:**
For payment-focused stablecoins, **fully reserved, transparently audited models** have become the standard for stability and trust.

## 2. Settlement Layers and Scalability

### Traditional Blockchain Challenges

**Early stablecoin deployment on general-purpose chains faced limitations:**

**Ethereum:**
- **Advantages**: Most decentralized, secure, established
- **Challenges**: Higher fees ($1-50 per transaction during congestion), slower confirmation (12-15 seconds per block, 5-10 minutes for confidence)

**Tron:**
- **Advantages**: Faster (3-second blocks), cheaper ($0.01-0.10 fees)
- **Challenges**: More centralized, less developer tooling
- **Reality**: Dominates retail USDT transfers in Asia due to low costs

### Purpose-Built Payment Networks (2024-2025)

Specialized high-performance networks optimized for payments emerged:

**Circle Arc:**
- USDC as native gas currency
- Sub-second deterministic finality
- Built-in FX engine for multi-currency
- Enterprise-grade reliability[^4][^5]

**Stripe/Paradigm Tempo:**
- Multi-stablecoin gas support (USDC, USDT)
- Sub-second finality
- Payment-specific primitives
- High throughput for e-commerce scale[^6][^7]

**Tether Stable/Plasma:**
- Plasma: Zero-fee USDT transfers
- Stable: Main settlement with StableBFT consensus
- USDT-based fee payment
- Retail-optimized architecture[^8]

**Performance Comparison:**

| Network | Finality | Throughput | Gas Currency | Cost per Tx |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Ethereum | 12-15 sec | ~15 TPS | ETH | $1-50 |
| Tron | 3 sec | ~2,000 TPS | TRX | $0.01-0.10 |
| Arc | <1 sec | ~10,000 TPS | USDC | <$0.01 |
| Tempo | <1 sec | ~10,000 TPS | USDC/USDT | <$0.01 |
| Stable/Plasma | <1 sec | ~10,000 TPS | USDT | $0 - $0.001 |

### Layer-2 Scaling Solutions

**Alternative approach:** Build on Ethereum but use Layer-2 for scalability

**Examples:**
- **Coinbase Base**: Optimistic rollup, low-cost USDC transactions
- **Polygon**: Sidechain, high throughput, EVM-compatible
- **Arbitrum/Optimism**: Optimistic rollups with Ethereum security

**Advantages:**
- Inherits Ethereum security
- Much lower fees (<$0.01 typically)
- Faster confirmation
- Existing tooling compatibility

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional complexity (bridging between layers)
- Withdrawal delays (optimistic rollups have 7-day challenge period)
- Less mature than Layer-1 options

### Multi-Chain Strategy

Many stablecoins are issued across multiple chains:

**USDC Deployments:**
- Ethereum
- Solana
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Arbitrum
- Base
- ...and more

**Merchant Decision:**
Support the networks most used by target customers. For example:
- **US/Europe**: Ethereum, Base, Polygon
- **Asia retail**: Tron (for USDT)
- **DeFi users**: Ethereum, Solana
- **Cost-sensitive**: Layer-2s, Tron, dedicated payment chains

## 3. Gas Fees and User Experience

### The Gas Token Problem

Traditional blockchain UX friction:
1. User wants to pay merchant 10 USDC
2. User needs USDC (for payment) + ETH (for gas fees)
3. User must acquire two different tokens
4. Gas fees fluctuate unpredictably
5. Complex for non-crypto-native users

**Result:** Poor user experience deterring mainstream adoption.

### Solutions: Gas Abstraction

**Approach 1: Stablecoin-as-Gas**

New payment-oriented blockchains use stablecoins themselves as gas:

**Tempo:** Accepts USDC/USDT for fees natively[^9]
- User only needs USDC
- Fees denominated in familiar dollars
- No volatile token exposure

**Arc:** Uses USDC for gas[^10]
- Predictable fee budgeting
- Single token for payments and fees
- Simplified accounting

**Stable/Plasma:** Use USDT for fees[^11]
- USDT variants (gasUSDT) for fee payment
- Zero-fee options for standard transfers
- Retail-friendly economics

**Approach 2: Paymaster / Account Abstraction**

**EIP-4337 Account Abstraction:**[^12]
- Smart contract wallets instead of EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts)
- **Paymaster** contracts sponsor gas fees on behalf of users
- User signs transaction, paymaster pays gas
- Gas fees can be deducted from stablecoin balance

**Implementation:**
```solidity
// Simplified paymaster concept
contract Paymaster {
    function validatePaymasterUserOp(UserOperation calldata userOp)
        external returns (bytes memory context) {
        // Merchant or platform sponsors gas
        // User's USDC balance debited equivalent amount
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Users transact with only stablecoins
- Merchants or platforms subsidize gas
- Flexible fee models (free, discounted, etc.)
- Improved onboarding experience

**Example: Tether Stable**

Uses EIP-4337/EIP-7702 scheme where:
- User's wallet temporarily acts as smart contract
- Designated paymaster pays gas in USDT on user's behalf
- User only sees stablecoin balance decrease
- Behind the scenes, sophisticated gas sponsorship[^13]

---

## 4. Custody and Wallet Infrastructure

### Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Models

**Custodial (Hosted Wallets):**

**How It Works:**
- Service provider holds private keys
- User balances tracked in internal database
- Transfers between users happen off-chain (instant)
- Periodically settled on-chain in batches

**Examples:**
- PayPal PYUSD within PayPal app
- Circle Account balances
- Exchange wallets (Coinbase, Kraken)

**Advantages:**
- Instant transfers between users on same platform
- Familiar UX (like banking app)
- Account recovery if user loses password
- No gas fees for internal transfers
- Simplified compliance (provider handles it)

**Trade-offs:**
- User doesn't control private keys
- Counterparty risk (trust the provider)
- Centralization (defeats some crypto benefits)

**Non-Custodial (Self-Custody Wallets):**

**How It Works:**
- User controls private keys
- All transactions happen on-chain
- Wallet software helps manage keys
- User responsible for security

**Examples:**
- MetaMask
- Ledger hardware wallet
- Trust Wallet
- Rainbow

**Advantages:**
- True ownership (not your keys, not your coins)
- No counterparty risk
- Censorship resistant
- Interoperable across services

**Trade-offs:**
- User responsible for key security
- Lost keys = lost funds (no recovery)
- Every transaction incurs gas fees
- More complex UX

### Hybrid Payment Architectures

**Modern payment systems support both:**

**Stripe Crypto Payments:**
1. Customer pays from self-custody wallet (on-chain)
2. Stripe detects payment on-chain
3. Stripe immediately credits merchant (internal ledger)
4. Stripe periodically batches settlements
5. Merchant receives fiat or stablecoin per preference

**Benefits:**
- Users can pay from any wallet
- Merchants get instant credit
- Best of both worlds

### Custody Solutions for Merchants

**Options for businesses receiving stablecoins:**

**1. Self-Custody with Multisig**
- Use multi-signature wallet (require 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 signatures)
- Hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage
- Best for businesses wanting full control

**2. Qualified Custodian**
- Regulated custodian (Coinbase Custody, Anchorage, BitGo)
- Segregated accounts
- Insurance coverage
- Professional security
- Compliance support

**3. Payment Processor Auto-Conversion**
- Accept stablecoin, immediately convert to fiat
- Never hold crypto (avoid volatility risk)
- Processor handles all crypto operations
- Familiar banking settlement

**4. Circle Account / Custodial Balance**
- Hold USDC in Circle account
- Earn interest on balances
- Instant transfers to other Circle users
- Direct redemption for USD
- API integration for treasury management

**Security Considerations:**
- **Hot wallets**: Online, for operational needs (higher risk)
- **Cold wallets**: Offline, for long-term storage (lower risk)
- **Multi-signature**: No single point of failure
- **Insurance**: Crime insurance for crypto holdings
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive logging for reconciliation

## 5. Integration with Existing Systems

### E-Commerce Platform Integration

**Goal:** Accept stablecoins as seamlessly as credit cards.

**Architecture Pattern:**

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Customer  │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Pays with USDC
       v
┌────────────────────┐
│ Payment Gateway    │  (Coinbase Commerce, Stripe, BitPay)
│ - Detects payment  │
│ - Validates amount │
│ - Handles crypto   │
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │ Webhook: payment_confirmed
          v
┌───────────────────────┐
│ E-commerce Platform   │  (Shopify, WooCommerce, Custom)
│ - Mark order paid     │
│ - Trigger fulfillment │
│ - Generate invoice    │
└───────────────────────┘
```

**Integration Points:**

**1. Checkout Widget**
```html
<!-- Example: Stripe crypto checkout -->
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
<div id="crypto-payment-element"></div>
<script>
  stripe.createPaymentElement({
    paymentMethods: ['crypto'],
    currency: 'usd',
    amount: 5000 // $50.00
  });
</script>
```

**2. Webhook Handling**
```javascript
// Receive payment confirmation
app.post('/webhooks/crypto-payment', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'payment.confirmed') {
    const orderId = event.metadata.order_id;
    const amount = event.amount; // in stablecoin
    const txHash = event.transaction_hash;

    // Mark order as paid
    updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'paid', {
      amount, txHash, paymentMethod: 'USDC'
    });

    // Trigger fulfillment
    fulfillOrder(orderId);
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

**3. Reconciliation**
- Daily reconciliation reports from payment processor
- Match blockchain transactions to internal orders
- Accounting integration (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.)

### Point-of-Sale (POS) Integration

**Physical retail accepting stablecoins:**

**Flow:**
1. Customer completes purchase
2. Cashier enters amount into POS
3. POS generates QR code (payment request)
4. Customer scans with wallet app
5. Customer confirms payment
6. POS detects payment on-chain (or via payment processor)
7. Receipt printed

**Technology:**
- QR code payment requests (BIP-21 standard)
- NFC for contactless payments (emerging)
- Lightning Network integration for instant Bitcoin payments
- Stablecoin-specific POS terminals

**Providers:**
- BitPay POS
- Flexa (Spedn network)
- Crypto.com Pay
- Custom integrations

### Banking and Treasury Integration

**Connecting stablecoin operations to traditional banking:**

**On-Ramp / Off-Ramp:**
- **On-ramp**: Convert fiat → stablecoin
- **Off-ramp**: Convert stablecoin → fiat

**Methods:**

**1. Direct Issuer Redemption**
- Circle: Redeem USDC 1:1 for USD (requires Circle Account)
- Paxos: Redeem PYUSD/USDP 1:1 for USD
- Minimum amounts typically $100k-$1M
- 1-2 business day settlement

**2. Exchange Services**
- Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini: Instant liquidity
- Competitive rates
- Lower minimums ($100+)
- Instant stablecoin ↔ fiat conversion
- Bank wire or ACH withdrawal

**3. OTC Desks**
- For large amounts ($1M+)
- Negotiated rates
- Custom settlement terms
- Relationship-based

**Treasury Management:**

**Automated Strategies:**
```
Daily Revenue in USDC
      ├─→ Convert 70% to USD (operating expenses)
      ├─→ Keep 20% in USDC (future payments)
      └─→ Invest 10% in yield-bearing USDC (treasury optimization)
```

**Tools:**
- Circle Account API for programmatic conversions
- Treasury management platforms (Gnosis Safe, Multis)
- Automated DeFi yield strategies (with appropriate risk management)

---

## 6. Compliance and Settlement Finality

### KYC/AML Requirements

**Merchant Obligations:**

**1. Know Your Customer (KYC)**
- May need to verify customer identity for large transactions
- Threshold-based reporting ($10k+ in many jurisdictions)
- Ongoing monitoring for suspicious patterns

**2. Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**
- Screen transactions against sanctions lists
- Monitor for structuring / smurfing patterns
- Maintain transaction records

**3. Travel Rule Compliance**
- FATF Travel Rule requires identity information for transactions >$1,000
- Emerging standards: TRISA, IVMS101
- Technical challenge for decentralized transactions

**Compliance Tools:**

**Address Screening:**
- **Chainalysis**: Transaction monitoring, sanctions screening
- **Elliptic**: Risk scoring, compliance reports
- **TRM Labs**: Blockchain intelligence
- **Crystal**: Address risk assessment

**Integration Example:**
```javascript
// Screen address before accepting payment
const riskScore = await chainalysis.screenAddress(customerAddress);

if (riskScore.risk === 'high') {
  // Reject transaction or require additional verification
  return { status: 'rejected', reason: 'high_risk_address' };
}

if (riskScore.sanctioned) {
  // Block sanctioned addresses
  freezeFunds();
  reportToAuthorities();
}
```

### Regulatory Frameworks

**United States:**

**Genius Act (proposed July 2025):**[^14][^15]
- Federal standards for stablecoin issuers
- Requirement: 1:1 backing with cash-equivalents
- Regular auditing and reserve attestations
- State or federal charter requirement
- Consumer protection provisions

**European Union:**

**MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) Regulation:**
- Covers "asset-referenced tokens" and "e-money tokens"
- Capital and liquidity requirements for issuers
- Ongoing reserve reporting
- Consumer redemption rights
- Harmonized framework across EU

**Merchant Impact:**
- Clearer legal status of stablecoins
- Reduced regulatory uncertainty
- Higher confidence for business adoption
- Standardized compliance requirements

### Settlement Finality

**Blockchain Benefits:**

**Irreversible Settlement:**
- Once transaction has sufficient confirmations, it cannot be reversed
- No chargeback risk (unlike credit cards)
- Final settlement without intermediary approval

**Finality Timing:**

| Network | Probabilistic Finality | Economic Finality |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Ethereum | ~12 seconds (1 block) | ~15 minutes (64 blocks) |
| Tron | ~3 seconds (1 block) | ~1 minute (19 blocks) |
| Arc | <1 second (deterministic) | <1 second |
| Tempo | <1 second (deterministic) | <1 second |
| Stable | <1 second (BFT) | <1 second |

**Merchant Advantages:**
- No chargeback fraud (saves 0.5-1% of revenue for many merchants)
- Instant settlement certainty
- Reduced working capital requirements

**Merchant Challenges:**
- No chargeback protection for legitimate disputes
- Must implement own dispute resolution
- Irreversible if customer claims non-delivery

**Solution:**
- Escrow smart contracts for high-value items
- Reputation systems
- Fraud prevention at point of sale
- Insurance products for crypto payments

### Issuer Controls

**Freeze/Blacklist Mechanisms:**

Stablecoin issuers maintain the ability to freeze accounts:[^16]

**Reasons:**
- Law enforcement requests
- Sanctions compliance (OFAC, EU sanctions lists)
- Smart contract exploit response
- Court orders

**Merchant Impact:**
- Very low probability for legitimate businesses
- Could happen if customer's funds are illicit origin
- Need policies for handling frozen funds
- Insurance may cover certain scenarios

**Recent Example:**
PayPal PYUSD incident (2025): Accidental minting and rapid correction demonstrated centralized control mechanisms.[^17]

**Trade-off:**
- Centralized control = regulatory compliance
- Decentralized ideals = censorship resistance
- Payment stablecoins prioritize compliance

![Multi-Chain Infrastructure](../imgs/payment-architecture-multi-chain.jpg)
*Multi-chain infrastructure enabling cross-chain stablecoin interoperability*

## 7. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Architecture

### The Multi-Chain Reality

**Fragmentation Challenge:**
- Same stablecoin (e.g., USDC) exists on 10+ chains
- Customer on Ethereum, merchant wants Polygon
- Non-interoperable without bridges

**Solutions:**

**1. Cross-Chain Bridges**
- Lock token on Chain A
- Mint equivalent on Chain B
- Trust assumptions vary

**Examples:**
- Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP): Native USDC burning/minting
- Layer Zero: General messaging protocol
- Wormhole: Multi-chain bridge

**2. Unified Stablecoin Standards**
- USDT0: Tether's cross-chain standard variant[^18]
- Swappable 1:1 across chains
- Reduces fragmentation

**3. Abstraction Layer Routing**
- Payment processor handles cross-chain complexity
- Customer pays on any chain
- Merchant receives on preferred chain
- Middleware manages bridging

**Architecture:**
```
Customer (Ethereum USDC)
      ↓
Payment Processor
      ├─→ Detect: Ethereum payment
      ├─→ Bridge: Ethereum → Polygon (via CCTP)
      └─→ Settle: Merchant receives Polygon USDC
```

### Built-In Interoperability

**Circle Arc FX Engine:**[^19]
- Native on-chain currency exchange
- USDC ↔ EURC ↔ other Circle stablecoins
- 24/7 automated market making
- No off-chain intermediaries

**Benefits:**
- Simplified multi-currency commerce
- Instant FX settlement
- Competitive rates
- Atomic swaps (no settlement risk)

---

## Conclusion: Architecture Decisions Framework

When implementing stablecoin payments, businesses must address:

**1. Network Selection**
- Target customer base (geographic, tech-savvy)
- Cost requirements (high-volume vs. high-value)
- Speed requirements (instant vs. minutes)
- Security/decentralization preferences

**2. Gas Fee Strategy**
- Stablecoin-as-gas networks (Arc, Tempo, Stable)
- Paymaster sponsorship (subsidize customer fees)
- Layer-2 low-cost options
- Multi-network support with intelligent routing

**3. Custody Model**
- Full self-custody with multisig
- Qualified custodian
- Payment processor auto-conversion
- Hybrid approach

**4. Integration Approach**
- Payment gateway (fastest, least control)
- Direct smart contract integration (most control, most complexity)
- Hybrid: gateway for UX, direct for treasury

**5. Compliance Framework**
- Address screening tools
- KYC/AML procedures
- Regulatory jurisdiction considerations
- Audit trail and reporting

**6. Treasury Management**
- Auto-convert to fiat strategy
- Stablecoin retention for operational needs
- Yield optimization for excess balances
- Multi-currency support

The "right" architecture depends on your specific business requirements, risk tolerance, and customer base. Most successful implementations start simple (payment gateway integration) and add sophistication (direct chain integration, multi-chain support, treasury optimization) as volume and expertise grow.
